        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission in the development of this site was to create a safe space for teenagers to have access to mental health awareness, support, and nearby accessibility. We wanted to also develop a chatbot to serve as an affordable version of customizable therapy available with premium features for small fees with varying time frames. By providing accessibility help and availability to a support network filled with advice and awareness from teens to teens, we create a safe and comforting environment where young adults struggling with or unaware of mental health can find resources and a network of support to help find their best selves.</p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Our main goal of the website was to make mental health awareness not only available, but accessible and affordable. Our marketing approach is to offer our chatbot therapy service with premium subscription packages available for communication customized by your own personal therapist tailored to you.</li>
            <li>In our society, although mental health is becoming a much more prevalent and important topic, most parents and caregivers of young children and teens do not believe in therapy, medical prescriptions, or other serious treatments for mental health. Especially since most serious and successful therapists charge somewhere between $200 and $800 dollars on average, and most families either cannot afford their prices or refuse to pay for someone to ‘tell their child they are sad’.</li>
            <li>With the help of our website and technology, we will make a profit through connecting with therapists willing to offer their services to our clients for a ranging price, receiving a company sponsorship, ad services, and a percent of our subscription profits.</li>
            <li>We also will be collaborating with other mental health resources and companies through ad services and article references.</li>

        <h3 style="background-color: lightgray">Anxiety</h3>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightgrey; padding: 1em;">Anxiety can be caused by many
            things, especially when you are in your teen years. Some situations that may
            cause anxiety are school, work, and dangerous situations.
            Just like depression, anxiety can be diluted and there are ways to cope with it.
            Here are some of the ways we cope with anxiety: </p>
        <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightgrey; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>RELAX ! Be mindful and simply relax. What we mean by relaxation is not just sitting around your house
                and
                doing absolutely nothing but actually doing an activity that is a technique, like yoga, tai chi, and
                deep
                breathing.</li>
            <li>Just like people coping with depression, you as well have to stay connected with people you love and
                places
                you love as well. Hang out with people that make you feel safe and are always there for what you need.
            </li>
            <li>Stay POSITIVE! Keep your head up. There is nothing to be upset about or anxious about.</li>
            <li>If you are going through a situation where you feel anxious and start thinking negative, remember that
                at the end of the day
                everything is going to be okay and that what is happening in your life now is not going to be the same
                in the next 3 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightgrey; padding: 1em;">These are some of our tips that
            we want to give out to you and that we feel will be the most useful to you.

        <h3 style="background-color: #cddeef">Depression</h3>

            cope with depression and we want to be able to help you comprehend your
            feelings. First thing is first, you are not alone, there are about 20 percent of teens that suffer with
            depression. Second, there are always ways to look for help and you have come to the right place to get help.
            Never be afraid to ask for help. Some tips that could be very helpful are:</p>
        <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#cddeef; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>Stay connected (don not hide from the world, there is always something to explore)</li>
            <li>Do things that make you feel good ( you like to listen to music then throw a little party in your room,
                you
                like to draw? We will create projects and share them with loved ones, etc)</li>
            <li>EAT HEALTHY ! keeping a healthy diet can prevent you from having a negative affect on your moods. (ex.
                Stay
                away from sugars and refined carbs since they are the main cause of a crash in energy and mood.</li>
        </ul>

            <p1 style="background-color: #cddeef">School is possibly one of the causes of depression in teens. According
                to the National Institute of Mental
                Health (NIHM) about 3.1 million teens who are 12 through 17 in the United States have had at least one
                major
                depressive episode. We would understand why these statistics would be accurate since school could be
                very
                stressful especially when you are a student in high school. Whether you are beginning high school or
                about
                to end it. We have you covered with some advice on any specific grade of high school. Click <a

        <h3 style="background-color: #77bbbb">Eating Disorders</h3>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#7bb3ad; padding: 1em;">Dealing with ones image is
            something that is always a bit unsettling, especially during these years when we
            feel quite self conscious. We have felt it too, and here are our tips:
            <ol style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#7bb3ad; padding: 1.5em;">
                <li>Assemble your team of supporters/healthcare professionals. This includes your primary physician (and
                    a referral), school counselors (if you are comfortable with them), friends, family, etc)</li>
                <li>Find healthier ways to cope with negative emotions. Try to identify what you are really feeling and
                    see how that affects your eating habits. Suggestions from us include hitting up a friend, listening
                    to music, reading, going out for a walk, etc</li>
                <li>Develop a good relationship with food! Do not be too rigid with rules, and allow yourself
                    flexibility. Dieting should not be in mind as it will make you preoccupied and even obsessed with
                    it. Attempt to eat every three hours and plan ahead with snacks and drinks, and remember to listen
                    to your body when it is asking for food!</li>
                <li>Learn how to accept and love yourself! Make a list of all your best positive qualities, stop body
                    checking, avoid fat talk, and most importantly, challenge negative self talk!</li>
            </ol>

        <a name="Bipolar Disorder"></a>
        <h3 style="background-color: #b5cbcc">Bipolar Disorder</h3>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#b5cbcc; padding: 1em;">Although it is not entirely known
            exactly what causes one to have bipolar disorder, there are definitely
            factors that play a role in the onset and progression of this disorder, which include genetic,
            neurochemical, and environmental factors. Currently it is thought that there is a neurobiological disorder
            that occurs in the brain with malfunctions of the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline.

            <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#b5cbcc; padding: 1em;">Here are some tips/advice for
                coping with Bipolar disorder and links to more resources to help you!</p>

            <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#b5cbcc; padding: 1.5em;">
                <li>If you are not doing so already, it is DEFINITELY a good idea to seek help from a professional, such
                    as your doctor, therapists, etc to seek medication which could help with symptoms as well as to
                    simply have someone to talk to! </li>
                <li>Monitor and track your symptoms and moods. If you notice anything obvious changing in your mood, it
                    might be too late to intercept, so look out for any subtle changes or things that trigger a reaction
                    out of you. If it helps, make a list early symptoms that have previously caused mood episodes.</li>
                <li>Develop a daily routine that you can follow to get symptoms under control and to keep it at bay.
                </li>
                <li>It would be a good idea to figure out how to find ways to exercise daily (aerobic exercise works
                    great, and this includes running, swimming, dancing, climbing, and even walking) ideally for 30
                    minutes a day (spreading it out b/w the day works as well)and to avoid sitting for long periods of
                    time</li>
                <li>Keep a strict sleep schedule! Not getting enough sleep can trigger an episode, so consistency is
                    key!</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#b5cbcc; padding: 1em;">Additional tips are to:</p>
            <ol style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#b5cbcc; padding: 1.5em;">
                <li>Avoid/minimize napping that will prevent you from sleeping at night</li>
                <li>Avoid electronics before heading off to bed and instead try taking a bath, reading a book, or
                    listening to relaxing music</li>
                <li>Reduce caffeine intake after lunch and alcohol at night as they interfere with your sleep</li>
                <li>Reach out to people for connection! It is important to not isolate yourself when it is support and
                    love you will really need to get ahead!</li>
                <li>Reach out and connect with supportive friends and family, which is a really therapeutic experience.
                </li>
                <li>Find a support group with others who are dealing with the same thing! You will feel understood, get
                    support, and perhaps find tips/advice you have not heard before</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <a name="OCD"></a>
        <h3 style="background-color: #97b4d7">OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)</h3>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#97b4d7; padding: 1em;">It is a terrible feeling to have
            compulsive behaviors and obsessive thoughts in your daily life, but we can
            help with managing and improving you daily life!</p>
        <ol style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#97b4d7; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>Find your triggers! Record a list of the triggers in your daily life, and the obsessions they provoke.
            </li>
            <li>Learn to resist OCD compulsions, as the more you try to avoid them, the scarier they seem. By repeatedly
                exposing yourself to triggers, you can learn to prevent compulsive behaviors, and medically this is
                known as exposure and response prevention.</li>
            <li>Manage stress, because although it does not directly cause OCD, it can trigger symptoms or make them
                worse. Physical exercise and connecting with others in person are also very effective ways to calm your
                nervous system.</li>
            <li>Make lifestyle changes, such as getting 30 minutes of aerobic activity daily, getting enough sleep, and
                avoiding alcohol and nicotine.</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#a6cdcd; padding: 1em;">If you are someone that suffers
            from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which is also known as PTSD whether it is
            due to an accident, shooting, or family experience, we want to sympathize with you because that as an awful
            experience for someone like you to experience. Let us tell you that you shouldn't stop you life, and you
            should continue to move further. It's easier said than done but we want to give you the help you want and
            need.</p>
        <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#a6cdcd; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>Some advice we would like to provide you with is to JUMP BACK! Do not close yourself or try to change
                your way of being.</li>
            <li>Remember that your life isn't over and you should live your best life because out of this experience you
                want to grow stronger.</li>
            <li>Stay away from DRUGS that can trigger harmful emotions and behaviors</li>
            <li>Stay away from DRUGS that can trigger harmful emotions and behaviors</li>
            <li>Talk, its always good to talk whenever you aren't feeling your best or feel like you are being reminded
                of past traumas. Talk to people you trust, family or even a counselor. People are always willing to
                help. Even talk to one of us !</li>
            <li>Again, having gone through an experience that was life changing isn't something that can change your
                life for the worse but it can change your life for the better .</li>

        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#afb8b7; padding: 1em;">Been a teenager like us
            especially in high school where your life starts to change and you begin to meet new
            people that can either affect your life in a positive way or in a negative way; you can come across people
            that dont want the best for you and peer pressure you to do things you do want to be but you do to fit in.
            They introduce you to substances like alcohol, marijuana and products that contain tobacco. Once fallen into
            the influence you begin to abuse it which is where the problem is caused. You can be at risk for many things
            like: </p>
        <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#afb8b7; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>Affecting your brain development</li>
            <li>Driving under the influence or being in a car of someone driving under the influence</li>
            <li>Making irrational decisons that can affect your life (unprotected sex = babies = harder to manage your
                life especially if you cant look out for yourself just yet)</li>
            <li>These are just some of the few risks but we want you guys to avoid that as soon as possible, starting by
                getting away from people that peer pressure you and become friends with people that would want to rather
                help you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#afb8b7; padding: 1em;">If there is an issue at home,
            talk with relatives at home and explain to them why you do what you do. If that
            isn't something you can do, talk to a professional and ask for help</p>
        <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#afb8b7; padding: 1.5em;">
            <li>Get yourself into a youth program </li>
            <li>We can only give you so much advice on how YOU should stop yourself but if you should want to help
                yourself in order for things to change.</li>

There are many summer internships for high school students just like you! Internships are the best way to bridge the gap between school and a career. It is a great experience in a field that you may possibly end up doing later on in life. There are so many internships in different fields, which is great if you are indecisive about your future and need some inspiration.</p>
            <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: lightskyblue; padding: 1em;">Here are some tips to keep in mind when applying to or attending a summer internship.</p>
            <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightskyblue; padding: 1.5em;">
                <li>Be open to new ideas and opportunities. You may not know anything about that specific field, but it doesn't hurt to look into it and try it out.</li>
                <li>NETWORK! Make friends. Talk to people. Stay in contact with people even after the internship is over. This will help you with future opportunities.</li>

                <p>Freshman year is tough, we have definetly been there. But we got through it and so can you! As much
                    as we all like to hope and wish that freshman year of high school will be exactly like all the
                    movies and TV shows and you will trip over the lunch tray and start falling before your future
                    boyfriend/girlfriend catches you and falls in love, unfortunately that could not be farther from the
                    reality of high school. Hopefully with our tips, freshman year will be as great as it can be and
                    will set you up for 3 more successful and happy years!</p>

                <h3  style="background-color: #97b4d7">Our Best Freshman Year Tips</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#97b4d7; padding: 1.5em;">
                        <li><strong>Come in with an open mind.</strong> Try not to have expectations for what this year
                            and your high school experience will be like.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be prepared for an academic challenge.</strong> The transition from middle school to
                            high school is not an easy one so remember that it is okay if the work does not come
                            naturally right from the get go. Relax and embrace the challenge knowing you will get used
                            to it!</li>
                        <li><strong>Be yourself.</strong> Try to remember that your true friends are going to want to be
                            friends with YOU, not what you think they want you to be. High school will be a much more
                            positive experience if you let your teachers get to know the real you and do not try to put
                            on a show.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do not succumb to peer pressure.</strong> We know its hard, but this goes hand in
                            hand with being yourself. Never do something you do not want to do or something you will
                            regret later. No this does not apply to staying out one minute past your curfew to get ice
                            cream, but you know what we are talking about ;).</li>
                        <li><strong>Be social.</strong> Freshman year is less about your schoolwork and more about
                            discovering your interests, finding your friends, and finding yourself and where you fit
                            into your high schools community.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 style="background-color: #cddeef">Social Advice!</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#cddeef; padding: 1.5em;">
                        <li><strong>Be honest yet modest.</strong> High school is hard because even though you might
                            have had friends who you went to middle school with, you still want to branch out and meet
                            new people. Obviously it is difficult to just jump right in to a new friendship, so when you
                            are talking to new people and getting to know each other, remember to tell stories in a way
                            that does not come off as bragging or self-centered. Be yourself but remember these people
                            do not know you and you do not know them so try not to come on too strong.</li>
                        <li><strong>Embrace who you are.</strong> Some people may just not connect with you and you
                            might feel the urge to change who you are so they will like you, but as hard as it is to
                            admit, some people just will not like you in life. There is no need to not like them in
                            return for it or hold them against them; just because they do not want to be best friends
                            does not mean that you cannot be the bigger person and be civil.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stand up for others, they will remember.</strong> We hate that it still exists, but
                            bullying will never not be an issue at any school and we always need to advocate for those
                            who cannot stand up for themselves. They may not be your best friends, but the worst feeling
                            in high school is knowing that someone is getting hurt and you did nothing to stop it when
                            you easily could have. Being a friend to everyone is the best way to start your high school
                            career.</li>
                    </ul>

                <a name="Time Management"></a>
                <h3 style="background-color: #7bb3ad">Time Management</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#7bb3ad; padding: 1.5em;">
                        <li><strong>Prioritize.</strong> Do not get overwhelmed, start by making a list of everything
                            you have to do each night and label each task by priority. Either do the easiest tasks first
                            or do the assignments for your morning classes first, or really any strategy that works for
                            you, and slowly check things off your list. Do not forget to take breaks and reward yourself
                            at the end of the day!</li>
                        <li><strong>Do not overbook yourself.</strong> You are just beginning high school, you want to
                            join as many clubs and teams as possible while still making friends and hanging out with
                            people, spending time with your family, and focusing on your schoolwork. Unfortunately you
                            will not be able to do it all. Pick three or four of the extracurriculars you are most
                            passionate or excited about and go all in on those.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do not multitask.</strong> It seems obvious but trying to start and finish multiple
                            tasks at the same time just means you will not be able to give either task your best effort
                            and it will just make you feel more overwhelmed and not in control. The best thing you can
                            do for yourself is to take everything one step at a time and give it your best effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>Take advantage of free periods and mornings.</strong> The most important lesson
                            everyone will always tell you about high school is to get sleep. And the most frustrating
                            piece of advice high schoolers get is to get sleep, but as much as we all hate hearing it
                            because it feels impossible, it really is true, sleep is critical. The number one way I get
                            as much sleep as I can is by using my free periods and my time before school to get work
                            done. If it is 12 at night and I still have three more assignments to get to, I know that
                            they will not be done correctly or well if I do them now, but if I start them in the morning
                            and finish them during my morning frees when I am more productive, my work will be correct
                            and complete.</li>

                <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
                <p>Sophomore year. You finally have your bearings and officially are no longer the baby of the high
                    school anymore! Most people will tell you that sophomore year is the easiest year, and that might be
                    true for some people, but this year is about grounding yourself and dedicating yourself to certain
                    activities, and to start exploring your interests by taking new and challenging courses. Hopefully
                    with our teams, you will be ready and prepared for all the obstacles to come!</p>

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#cddeef; padding: 1em;">Settle down in your options. This is your last year to really explore other extracurricular
                    activities and it is really the time to commit to your clubs and teams for the next 3 years. Maybe
                    join a new club you have been on the fence about or try a new sport, just to see if there might be a
                    real talent or passion there, but stick with those original clubs for freshman year too, do not just
                    leave them high and dry! Besides from clubs, you also want to lock in on your favorite classes,
                    think of the people who you can trust and you consider your closest friends. You are not last on the
                    totem pole anymore, so be confident and start to find your place!</p>

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#a6cdcd; padding: 1em;">College. That big nightmare that’s looming over your head that you are currently are pretending does
                    not and never will exist or affect you. Well, time to face the music my friend. Here are some tips
                    to make the reality a little less harsh.</p>
                <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#a6cdcd; padding: 1.5em;">
                    <li><strong>Make two lists.</strong> One listing all of your interests, passions, talents, or things
                        you just enjoy to do; and another on dream qualities or characteristics you would love to have
                        at your college. It can be as crazy as an infinity pool with a cotton candy bar in the bathroom,
                        or waterbeds in the dorm, but try to be more realistic. Think about questions like 'Do I want a
                        gym on campus where I can go to work out even if I am not part of a sports team?', 'What kind of
                        dining hall would work for me and my dietary needs?', 'Would I be able to have a single or even
                        a four person dorm room if I wanted one?', 'Do I want a school where I have to commit to a major
                        during the application process?'</li>
                    <li><strong>Take a practice SAT and ACT.</strong> This is going to be the worst part of the college
                        process; but the earlier you figure out which test is right for you, the better your late
                        sophomore and early junior year will be.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start asking people</strong> who know you what they think a good school environment
                        would be for you. If you are as frozen in anxiety as I was during the beginning of my college
                        process, you have no idea what you want or how to even say the word college. Well in that case,
                        the best thing you can do is ask for help. Ask your family what region of the world they think
                        is a good fit for you, ask your college counselor if they think a small liberal arts or a big
                        university seems more right for you. Do not ask questions they cannot answer like 'what should I
                        major in?'', but start to get a feel for where you should start looking by asking the people who
                        know you the best.</li>

                    plummeting like the Titanic. Well we do not even really know ourselves, but here is how we try:</p>
                <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#97b4d7; padding: 1.5em;">
                    <li><strong>Dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to yourself</strong> to do whatever you feel like you
                        need to do that day. It could be something as easy as take a nap, have a bath, stretch, eat a
                        whole bag of skittles, use the time to really indulge in self-love.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a routine</strong> that works for you and stick to it, even on the weekends ;).
                        Pick a time to wake up every morning, a time to go to bed around every night, times where you
                        get a snack, days where you watch a TV show or times to spend with your family.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find the times</strong> and places where you are most productive, most unproductive, and
                        most relaxed and remember them, either keep them in your phone or write them down; and in those
                        times where you went out with a friend only to come home to a pile of homework due tomorrow, you
                        will thank us.</li>

                        will only as bad as you make it.</li>
                    <li>It sounds corny, but <strong>take everything one day at a time.</strong> If you start worrying
                        about the AP exam that is in 6 months or the standardized test date in 5 months, you will never
                        relax and you will not spend time and focus on what is more prevalent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find your people</strong> who will be your support system, and appreciate them. Be the
                        support system for others, but always have someone to fall back on, and never take them for

                        to the fullest and get as much done as you can.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicate an hour 3 or 4 times a week to standardized test prep.</strong> it iss annoying
                        but the sooner you get it done, the easier junior year will be, you will be able to spend that
                        time doing fun activities once it is over.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a planner.</strong> You will be grateful later when you accidentally schedule a
                        dinner with your friend on a Thursday night when you forgot you have a physics test the next

                        overbook yourself, junior year is overwhelming enough and the most important thing you need is

                        Google it up! Search up the name of your class, the textbook chapter or book that you are

                        struggle with in high school. It is hard to ask for help because you feel like you are cheating,
                        or taking a short cut, or it somehow makes you undeserving of what you receive, but believe me
                        it does not. The people around you who offer help are people who were in your shoes however many
                        years ago and want you to get the help they never asked for.</li>

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightsteelblue; padding: 1em;">The most well-known way of applying to college. We know it seems daunting and it looks like a digital
                    version of the stress looming over your brain, but if you take it step by step, we can all get done.
                </p>
                <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightsteelblue; padding: 1.5em;">
                    <li><strong>Start early and give yourself time for each section.</strong> The common app is the bulk
                        of your application for most colleges along with essays and supplemental writings, and there are
                        multiple parts. So the earlier you register and knock off the small parts, the smoother the
                        whole process will be.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make a game plan.</strong>Plan out what part of the common app you can do when and who
                        you need to talk to in order to fill in any gaps. Make a list of your extracurriculars for your
                        activities section. Think through your timing and prioritize your sections to get it done fast
                        and well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pick and choose your strongest activities.</strong>Remember you only have 10 activities
                        slots available, so even if you have done 30 or 40 extracurriculars, pick the ones that best
                        represent you and that you are proud of. You want your application to reflect you in as many
                        different lights as you can.</li>

                <ul style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:lightblue; padding: 1.5em;"> 
                    <li><strong>Do not the adults in your life take over your process.</strong>Remember that YOU are the
                        only one applying to college. Your parents and family are there to support you, but remind them
                        that this is your process, and you need to be in the drivers seat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Try not to fall in love.</strong>If you have a one-track mind on your top college, you
                        will neglect to see all the amazing colleges around you, and on the off chance you do not get
                        accepted to that one school, it will be hard to pick yourself back up and get that excite about
                        the schools you do get into. Be excited about every school you apply to, and if you do not have
                        butterflies when you hit the apply button to a college, it might not be the one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deadlines are deadlines, so treat them like deadlines.</strong> Applications are
                        serious, and if you forget to hit the send button, there is no extention waiting for you on the
                        other side. You have one shot and one only. If you know yourself and know that you are not good
                        with deadlines, mark the appliation deadlines as a few days before the real deadlines and have
                        your family be set on that date as well, giving you a security blanket if you forget to send it
                        in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Never forget your manners.</strong>Emails and interviews are some of the first
                        impressions college admission counselors will have of you. Always have a counselor or a parent
                        grammar check your emails and prepare for interviews. They may not be a top priority, but they
                        are important to forge good connections.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Try not to overthink it.</strong>Although the common app essay and supplements seem like
                        the most important part of your application because they are the only place to show your
                        personality and let the counselors reading your application to see the real you, remember you
                        can only fit so much within the word limit. The best way to get started is to think of the essay
                        as a way to introduce yourself to someone who has never met you and knows nothing about you.
                        What would you tell them about yourself to let them build an impression of you? And go from
                        there.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not be afraid of being yourself.</strong>If you are funny in real life, add some of
                        your humor in your essay! You want to be as truthful and real as you can be, so open yourself up
                        and be yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid the sob stories</strong>It has been said over and over, but stay away from death,
                        divorce, and depression. College admission counselors who are reading your essays have seen the
                        classic pity me story over and over again. The main goal is to be yourself and to be unique.
                        Tell a story that others cannot tell the way you can.</li>

                    <li><strong>Try to enjoy your last year of high school.</strong>It sounds impossible and like a
                        death wish, but do not spend every second of your spare time on your college applications. Go
                        out to dinner with friends, go try the new dance class downtown, take breaks and remember that
                        you only have so much time left here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it count.</strong>You have spent nights, weekends, vacations, shed blood and tears
                        working so hard to get where you are, so do not give up or waste all that work just yet. It may
                        seem unfair because all you want to do now is sit back and relax, but take the time to enjoy the
                        things about high school that you love.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take advantage of the yearbook!</strong>Get in all the yearbook photos, find the perfect
                        senior quote, sign as many yearbooks as you can. Take the perfect school photo. Make the
                        yearbook what you want it to be, and make it something you will love to look back on after
                        graduation.</li>
